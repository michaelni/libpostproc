# License

libpostproc is licensed under the GNU General Public License
version 2 or later (GPL v2+). See the file `COPYING.GPLv2` for details.

Should you, for whatever reason, prefer to use version 3 of the GPL, then
the configure parameter `--enable-version3` will activate this licensing option
for you. Read
`COPYING.GPLv3` to learn the exact legal terms that apply in this case.

There are a handful of files under other licensing terms, namely:

* `tests/reference.pnm` is under the expat license.
