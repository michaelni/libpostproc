libpostproc maintainers
=======================

Below is a list of the people maintaining different parts of the
libpostproc code.

All help and contribution is highly welcome


Please try to keep entries where you are the maintainer up to date!

*Status*, one of the following:
[X] Old code. Something tagged obsolete generally means it has been replaced by a better system and you should be using that.
[0] No current maintainer [but maybe you could take the role as you write your new code].
[1] It has a maintainer but they don't have time to do much other than throw the odd patch in.
[2] Someone actually looks after it.

A (CC <address>) after the name means that the maintainer prefers to be CC-ed on
patches and related discussions.

              patches to the given subsystem. This is either an in-tree file,
